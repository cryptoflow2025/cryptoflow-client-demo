This is a client demo for Ctyptoflow's merchant application payment.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## For testing

You can create a project in https://cryptoflow-xi.vercel.app/merchant first.

You can find project ID in the link of your project page, like https://cryptoflow-xi.vercel.app/project/<strong>${projectId}</strong>.

Then you can use the project ID to test the payment.

Feel free to use this code if you need to integrate the payment into your own website/application. The official documentation is also on the way.
